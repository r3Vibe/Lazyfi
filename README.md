*This is a wifi hacking tool.
*I am not responsible for what you do with the script.
*Do not harm anyone.

{On your first run script will install itself in your kali pc

The name Lazyfi is because it has a automatic option that let's you hack a wifi without any interaction with pc.
just specify the ssid and you are good to go.
it also has a manual method.
